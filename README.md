# Messenger

This application is also my assignment in my Object Oriented Programming course. We have to design a simple version of Messenger. Anyway, I have already built an application allowing chatting through a common local network using Java Socket and Multithreading.

## Installation

This project is written by Java SDK 21 and JavaFX Framework. Make sure that you have already installed IntelliJ IDE and this Java version. 

Clone this project set up the environment, and run the file Server.java first. After that, you can run Client.java multiple times. Multiple clients can chat with others under the same network.
